## 1. Project Identity

**Project name:** HAVEL  
**Category:** Capture The Flag (CTF) Management Platform  
**Track:** *Epitech Innovative Project – Technical Track (Tech 4)*  
**Selected complementary objectives:**  
- **Performance Optimization**  
- **Collaboration with Experts**

**Goal:**
Develop a performant, scalable, and intuitive platform to manage CTF (Capture The Flag) events, capable of handling multiple challenge types — from simple containers to complex network infrastructures — with automated deployment and advanced orchestration capabilities.

## 2. Problem Statement

Current CTF management platforms (like CTFd or RootTheBox) offer solid foundations but show **severe limitations** when facing large-scale or technically demanding events:

- **Performance bottlenecks** during concurrent challenge deployment;  
- **Limited scalability** for complex network-based challenges (multi-VM topologies);  
- **Rigid architectures** that make integrating new technologies or infrastructures difficult;  
- **Lack of expert-driven validation**, especially in cybersecurity, virtualization, and performance engineering.

This results in wasted time, inefficient resource use, and difficulty hosting technically rich or large competitions.

## 3. Havel’s Value Proposition

**Havel** redefines CTF hosting by providing:
1. **Intuitive event and challenge management:**  
   A modern, accessible interface that simplifies the setup and monitoring of CTFs.
2. **Advanced orchestration layer:**  
   Seamless deployment and isolation of challenges using Docker, Proxmox, and eventually Kubernetes/WireGuard.
3. **Optimized performance and scalability:**  
   Continuous benchmarking, load testing, and performance-oriented architecture to ensure stable competition environments.
4. **Expert-driven development process:**  
   Validation and feedback from DevOps and cybersecurity experts throughout the project lifecycle.
5. **Open architecture:**  
   Designed to be modular and extendable, enabling future integration with external scoring systems, monitoring tools, and cloud infrastructures.

## 4. Target Audience

| **Collaborate with technical experts**              | Receive actionable feedback and implement improvements in architecture, performance, and security.   |
| **Ensure accessibility and usability**              | Deliver a clean, intuitive, and accessible UI/UX for users and administrators.                       |
| **Establish documentation excellence**              | Provide detailed functional, technical, and architectural documentation meeting Epitech’s standards. |

## 6. Alignment with Technical Track Requirements

| Technical Track Goal | Havel Implementation |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Active technology watch** | Continuous benchmarking of orchestration and network tools. |
| **Proofs of Concept (POC)** | Early prototypes testing Docker, Proxmox, and WireGuard integration. |
| **Documented architecture** | Dedicated section with diagrams, services, and performance logic. |
| **Code standards and testing** | Established linting, CI pipelines, and integration/unit testing. |
| **Performance optimization** | Defined KPIs and measurable before/after comparisons. |
| **Collaboration with experts** | Recorded exchanges, code reviews, and applied optimizations. |

## 7. Long Term Vision

Havel aims to become an **open and modular CTF infrastructure manager** — a reference tool for organizing secure, high-performance cybersecurity competitions.  
By integrating expert feedback, automation, and rigorous documentation, it aspires to evolve into a professional-grade orchestration framework usable by schools, companies, and cybersecurity communities worldwide.

## 8. Summary

Havel is more than a CTF platform — it is a **technical innovation project** combining:
- High-level **engineering excellence** (architecture, performance, scalability),  
- **Collaboration with industry experts**,  
- And a commitment to **continuous improvement** through testing, documentation, and experimentation.

Through this approach, the team demonstrates its ability to deliver a technically robust, well-documented, and performance-driven project — perfectly aligned with the expectations of Epitech’s Technical Track.
