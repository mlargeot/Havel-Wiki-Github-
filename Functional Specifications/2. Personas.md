## 1. Overview

The **Havel** platform is designed for cybersecurity professionals, educators, and students who organize or participate in **Capture The Flag (CTF)** events.  
Each persona represents a key type of user interacting with the system — from event creation to challenge participation.

These personas guide:

- Functional priorities (challenge and event management),
- UI/UX design choices,
- Technical decisions related to scalability, performance, and security.

## 2. Primary Personas
