# Scope

## 1. Purpose of the Document

This document defines the **functional scope** of the **Havel** project.  
It clarifies the project’s **boundaries**, **key features**, and **expected deliverables** for the current and upcoming versions.

The objective is to ensure alignment between:

- The **project vision** (Executive Summary),
- The **user needs and personas**,
- And the **mandatory and complementary objectives** defined in the Epitech Technical Track.

## 2. Project Overview

**Havel** is a next-generation **CTF (Capture The Flag) management platform** designed to simplify the creation, deployment, and management of cybersecurity challenges.

Unlike existing solutions, Havel focuses on:

- **Scalable and automated orchestration** of both simple and complex infrastructures,
- **Integration of network-based challenges**, allowing multi-machine topologies,
- **Performance optimization** to guarantee fast and stable deployments,
- And **collaboration with technical experts** to validate architectural decisions.

The goal is to make Havel a reference solution for running educational and competitive cybersecurity events at any scale.

## 4. Constraints and Assumptions

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|**Functional Constraints**|The platform must handle multiple simultaneous deployments and support both container-based and network-based challenges.|
|**Performance Constraints**|Challenge environments must deploy quickly and remain stable under concurrent access.|
|**Security Constraints**|Each challenge instance must be isolated to prevent interference between users or teams.|
|**Organizational Constraints**|Collaboration with at least two external technical experts must be documented and reflected in project updates.|
|**Legal & Ethical Constraints**|All user data collected during events must respect privacy and comply with GDPR standards.|
