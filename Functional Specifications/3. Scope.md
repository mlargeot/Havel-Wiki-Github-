# Scope

### Event Mode (CTF-Style Only)

For the initial release, Havel will focus exclusively on supporting (competitive) cybersecurity events (CTF mode). This approach is inspired by established platforms such as CTFd, with enhancements for modern UX, instance management, and security. The platform will not provide a persistent training/library mode or open-ended practice labs at this stage.

#### Core Capabilities

**Event Lifecycle**

- Organizers can create scheduled events (start/end date, time zone).
- Registration: supports team and individual participation (configurable).
- Event configuration includes scoring rules, challenge selection, registration/access policies, and basic branding (event logo, color scheme).
- Pre-event “lobby” and countdown; post-event scoreboard freeze and archive.

**Challenge Management**

- Authors can create, edit, or retire challenges before and during events.
- Supported challenge types:
	- Q&A (static flag or answer-based)
    - Container-based (Docker, for services or exploitation)
    - Networked VM-based (multiple VMs with defined network topology; _see Hosting section_)
    - Simple VM (HTB like type of content, 1vm with vulnerabilities to exploit)
- Each challenge can be associated with files (attachments), hints, and clarifications.
- Unlock conditions and first-blood mechanics are available.
- Challenge visibility can be toggled by event admins.

**Instance Provisioning**

- On-demand deployment of per-user or per-team challenge instances for container and VM-based challenges.
- VPN connection is required: all participants must connect to a provided VPN profile to access isolated challenge machines. No direct internet exposure for challenge VMs.
- Resource quotas for instances (CPU, RAM, disk) and per-team/user concurrency limits.
- Start, stop, restart controls for users within event rules.
- Automatic cleanup (TTL) for idle or completed instances.

**Flag Submission and Scoring**

- Real-time flag submissions with instant feedback (success/failure only).
- Flexible flag validation (exact match but possible to set multiples flags as CTFD for Q&A answers for example).
- Rate limiting and anti-abuse mechanisms.
- First-blood support: bonus for earliest solves.
- Dynamic scoreboard with team/user rankings, optional freeze.

**Event Communication**

- Announcements and notifications: event-wide and per-challenge.
- Clarification system: players can ask questions, admins/moderators respond publicly or privately.
- Audit log for all admin/mod actions.

**User and Team Management**

- User registration and authentication.
- Team creation, join codes, roster management, captain assignment.
- Role-based permissions: player, captain, admin.

**Administration**

- Dashboard for event health (instance stats, resource usage, flag submission metrics).
- Instance quota enforcement and resource consumption tracking.
- Challenge set curation and challenge versioning.
- Basic cost estimation for resource usage (automated billing).

**Security and Compliance**

- VPN-only network access to challenge infrastructure.
- Isolation between teams and users at the network layer.
- No persistent data retained from event to event (unless required for audit/legal).

# Out of Scope for initial release (Ways of improvement)

- **Training/Library Mode:** No ongoing, self-paced challenge access outside scheduled events.
- **Non-VPN Access:** No direct SSH/RDP/web access to challenge VMs without VPN.
- **Blue Team/Defensive/Forensics Labs:** No persistent environments, packet capture, or defensive telemetry.
- **Scenario Orchestration:** No timed injects, blue/red/white team orchestration, or instructor scripting.
- **Automated Billing:** No integration with cloud provider billing APIs; only manual cost estimates.
- **Advanced Integrations:** No SIEM/logging, external chat, or complex SSO for MVP.
- **Persistent Lab Scheduling:** No reservations or calendar-based lab time.
- **Multi-event Coordination:** Each event is managed independently; no cross-event leaderboards or federated user data.

# Rationale

This focused event-only scope allows rapid delivery and ensures reliability for the most common CTF use case. It provides robust, modern features for event organizers and participants—including per-team isolation and operational security via VPN—while laying a solid foundation for future expansion into persistent labs, blue-team scenarios, and more advanced cyber range features.
