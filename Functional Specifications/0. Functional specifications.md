# Functional specifications

## Section purpose

The **Functional specifications** section is the single source of truth for how the platform is intended to behave from a user and business perspective. It captures the why and what of features -challenges, events, hosting, flags, scoring, and administrationâ€”so Product, Design, Engineering, Security, and Operations stay aligned on scope, user journeys, rules, and acceptance criteria. By describing expected behaviors (not implementation), it reduces ambiguity, accelerates onboarding, informs UI/UX and API/data model design, and enables traceable QA test cases and release readiness checks. As a living, versioned reference, it supports roadmap planning, risk management, and consistent decision-making, ensuring the delivered system matches stakeholder expectations and remains maintainable over time.
