# Challenge Types and Requirements

## Q&A

#### Description

A **Q&A challenge** is based on the participantâ€™s ability to provide the exact expected answer(s) to a predefined question within a specific theme. This type of challenge primarily assesses factual knowledge.

#### Mandatory fields

- Question    
- Accepted answer(s)

#### Response type

- Free text (as flag)
- Single choice
- Multiple choices

#### Validation

In the case of a **free text** response, the flag must be written exactly as expected. However, you can define multiple accepted flags to account for variations in case sensitivity and white space as needed.

## Container

#### Description

A **Container challenge** is based on a Docker container which, being lighter than a virtual machine, consumes fewer resources. Beyond performance considerations, this type of challenge makes it possible to highlight the vulnerability of a specific service or a particular version of that service.

#### Mandatory fields

- Docker image reference or Dockerfile    
- Exposed ports
- Run command
- Resource limits

#### Response type

- Flag

#### Security

Read-only FS options, network policies, secret injection for flags.

## Multi-VMs

#### Description

A **Multi-VM challenge** is based on multiple interconnected virtual machines containing one or more vulnerabilities to be exploited. The goal is to achieve the highest possible privilege level within the infrastructure and to gain access to sensitive data on one or more machines (e.g., HackTheBox or TryHackMe machines).

#### Need to provide

- Multiple ISOs/OVAs
- Network topology
- Instance sizes

#### Network topology

A visual editor inspired by **GNS3**: it allows users to drag and drop nodes (VMs or services), connect them, and design the network topology graphically. Once the topology is defined, it can be exported into manifests compatible with different providers (e.g., Docker Compose, Kubernetes, Proxmox). This approach enables quick modeling of complex infrastructures while ensuring portability and reproducibility.

> For network topology, we can also consider creating a custom, well-documented method using configuration files to build the topology without relying on the graphical interface, which may be more convenient for users who are comfortable with this approach.

#### Networking

- Subnets, routing, firewall rules
- Per-link bandwidth/latency (optional advanced).

#### Acceptance

- Type selection drives dynamic forms showing only relevant inputs.
- Topology builder supports create, edit, delete nodes and links, validates connectivity, and exports deterministic manifests.

## Simple VMs

#### Description

A **Single-VM challenge** is based on a single virtual machine with no network connectivity, containing one or more vulnerabilities to be exploited. The goal is to achieve the highest possible privilege level on the machine itself (e.g., HackTheBox or TryHackMe machines).

#### Need to provide

- ISO or OVA
- Instance size
