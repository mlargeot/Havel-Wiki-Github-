# VM Provisioning SDK

## Purpose

- Provider-agnostic SDK, initially integrating with the **Proxmox API** to provision and manage:
    - Virtual machines (create, start/stop, snapshot, destroy)
    - Networking resources

## Extensibility

- Support for additional providers through adapters (e.g., VMware, KVM/libvirt, major cloud platforms).

## Consistency

- Normalized handling of instance lifecycle events, status reporting, and metrics collection.

## Acceptance

- Provider credentials stored securely
- Operations retried with exponential backoff
- Provisioning processes are idempotent
